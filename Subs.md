<h1><strong>Overview</strong></h1>

<p>Help us determine emotion conveyed in a given text fragment. Please read the instructions below carefully.&nbsp;</p>
<hr>

<h1><strong>Steps</strong></h1>

<ol>
	<li>Read the text fragment until the end and select one emotion that is conveyed in the text.</li>
	<li>If you think that there are <strong><u>multiple people</u></strong> speaking in the text fragment, tick the corresponding box in the questionnaire ("Multiple people talking in the sub").</li>
	<li>If you see a blend of different emotions in one fragment (for example, surprise is replaced by anger), choose the option "Multiple non-neutral emotions".&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<hr>

<h1><strong>Rules &amp; Tips</strong></h1>

<p><strong>Rules:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Due to some possible errors in my preprocessing, an empty subtitle or a subtitle with a word part that does not make any sense might appear on the screen. If this happens, tick the "No text in the annotation object" box.</li>
	<li>If you see that the logical order of sentences is clearly mixed, for example, "<em>It was about vampires. I saw a cool film yesterday.</em>" instead of "<em>I saw a cool film yesterday. It was about vampires</em><em>.</em>", then tick the "The text is not in a logical order" box. If you still can figure out the emotion conveyed in such a fragment, then annotate it. If it is too confusing, choose the "I can't decide" option.</li>
	<li>Be very careful with Step 3. If there is a neutral state changing into a non-neutral, emotional state in the text, choose the corresponding emotion label and <strong>do NOT tick</strong> "Multiple non-neutral emotions" box. This annotation is about overall emotional perception that the text leaves you with.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tips</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Make sure to read the whole fragment before answering!</li>
	<li>If and only if you cannot assign one of the given labels, or when the text fragment is very confusing, then use the option "I can't decide".&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Do not overthink it: do not spend minutes on assessing the fragment after reading.</li>
	<li>If you want to quit before your batch is complete, you can do it by clicking on the :house: button. Your answers will still be registered.</li>
</ul>
