# Annotator-instructions
Three sets of instructions for the annotators helping me with the emotion recognition project.

Hi everyone!

If you got this link from me, then you had volunteered to annotate some data for my master thesis project.  
Check your mailbox for an invitation to collaborate. You should have received an email from Labelbox with the link.  
Something like this:  
![Invitation link](/invitation.png)

Follow the instruction from Labelbox to set your account. 
Unless you have a very old version of your browser, the web interface of the questionnaire should work just fine.  

**I strongly recommend you to work in _full screen mode_ of your browser.**

## Depending on the task you are assigned to, read the corresponding list of instructions.
*Do not start annotating before you read the instructions!*

Task | Link
------------ | -------------
Video annotation | [video](/Video.md)
Subtitle annotation | [subs](/Subs.md)
Video + subs annotation | [video_subs](/Video_subs.md)
