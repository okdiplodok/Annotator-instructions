<h1><strong>Overview</strong></h1>

<p>Help us determine facial emotion depicted in a given video fragment. Please read the instructions below carefully.&nbsp;</p>
<hr>

<h1><strong>Steps</strong></h1>

<ol>
	<li>Please <strong>mute the sound on your computer.&nbsp;</strong>The following test concerns facial emotions, hence the audio cue should be not presented. The default configuration of our video player is also muted. Please <strong>do NOT unmute</strong> the video player in the questionnaire.</li>
	<li>Watch the video fragment until the end.</li>
	<li>If there is &nbsp;only <strong><u>one face</u></strong> which appears in the video fragment, evaluate the facial emotion and select the appropriate emotion label.</li>
	<li>If there is <u><strong>more than one face</strong></u> appearing in the video fragment or <u><strong>no face</strong></u> at all, tick the corresponding boxes in the questionnaire ("More than one visible face").</li>
	<li>If you see a blend of different emotions in one fragment (for example, surprise on the face is replaced by anger), chose the option "Multiple (non-neutral) emotions".&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<h1><strong>Rules &amp; Tips</strong></h1>

<p><strong>Rules:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Assign the emotion labels based on the <strong>facial expressions.&nbsp;</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Attention!&nbsp;</strong>If you see more than one person in the video fragment, but you base your annotation solely on one person (i.e. you can only see the other people's backs, their faces are hidden from the camera), you should not do Step 4.</li>
	<li>Be very careful with Step 5. If you see a neutral expression changing into a non-neutral, emotional face, choose the corresponding emotion label and <strong>do NOT tick</strong> "Multiple (non-neutral) emotions" box. This annotation is about overall emotional perception that the faces in the video leaves you with.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tips</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Make sure to watch the whole fragment before answering!</li>
	<li>If and only if you cannot assign one of the given labels or when the video fragment is very confusing, then use the option "I can't decide".&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Do not overthink it: do not spend minutes on assessing the fragment after watching.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
