# Annotator-instructions
Three sets of instructions for the annotators helping me with the emotion recognition project.

If you got this link from me, then you had volunteered to annotate some data for my master thesis project.  
Check your mailbox for an invitation to collaborate. You should have received an email from Labelbox with the link.  
Something like this:
