<h1><strong>Overview</strong></h1>

<p>Help us determine emotion depicted in a fragment which combines a video with a textual subtitle. <br>
Please read the instructions below carefully.&nbsp;</p>

<h1><strong>Steps</strong></h1>

<ol>
	<li>The default configuration of our video player is muted. If you hear any sound from the video player, please <strong>mute the sound on your computer.&nbsp;</strong>.</li>
	<li>Watch the video fragment until the end and read the subtitle.</li>
	<li>If there is &nbsp;only <strong><u>one face</u></strong> which appears in the video fragment, evaluate the emotion of the fragment and select the appropriate emotion label.</li>
	<li>If there is <u><strong>more than one face</strong></u> appearing in the video fragment or <u><strong>no face</strong></u> at all, tick the corresponding boxes in the questionnaire ("More than one visible face" or "No face in the whole video").</li>
	<li>If you see a blend of different emotions in one fragment (for example, surprise on the face or in the text is replaced by anger), choose the option "Multiple (non-neutral) emotions".&nbsp;</li>
  <li>If you think that there are <strong><u>multiple people</u></strong> speaking in the text fragment, tick the corresponding box in the questionnaire ("Multiple people talking in the sub").</li>
	<li>Sometimes when the video is too short (i.e. less than 2 seconds), the video player does not show the picture at all. If you see a white screen through the whole video fragment, tick "Problems with video playback".&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Due to some possible errors in my preprocessing, an empty subtitle or a subtitle with a word part that does not make any sense might appear on the screen. If this happens, tick the "No text in the annotation object" box.</li>
	<li>If you see that the logical order of sentences is clearly mixed, for example, "<em>It was about vampires. I saw a cool film yesterday.</em>" instead of "<em>I saw a cool film yesterday. It was about vampires</em><em>.</em>", then tick the "The text is not in a logical order" box. <br>
  If you still can figure out the emotion conveyed in such a fragment, then annotate it. If it is too confusing, choose the "I can't decide" option.</li>
</ol>
<hr>

<h1><strong>Rules &amp; Tips</strong></h1>

<p><strong>Rules:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Assign the emotion labels based on the <strong>both facial expressions and text.&nbsp;</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Attention!&nbsp;</strong>If you see more than one person in the video fragment, but you base your annotation solely on one person (i.e. you can only see the other people's backs/their faces are hidden from the camera <strong>AND</strong> they are not speaking), you should not do Step 4.</li>
	<li>Be very careful with Step 5. If you see a neutral expression changing into a non-neutral, emotional face, choose the corresponding emotion label and <strong>do NOT tick</strong> "Multiple (non-neutral) emotions" box. This annotation is about overall emotional perception that the face in the video leaves you with.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tips</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Make sure to watch the whole fragment before answering!</li>
	<li>If and only if you cannot assign one of the given labels or when the video fragment is very confusing, then use the option "I can't decide".&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Do not overthink it: do not spend minutes on assessing the fragment after watching.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>If you have any comments on a particular video fragment that you think I will need for my analysis (i.e. there is a noise in the data that I didn't mention in the questionnaire, there is a systematic noise in your batch and etc.), then feel free to write them down in the comment section.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>If you want to quit before your batch is complete, you can do it by clicking on the :house: button. Your answers will still be registered.</li>
</ul>
